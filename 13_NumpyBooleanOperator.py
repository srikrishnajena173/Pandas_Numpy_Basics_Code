# Boolean operator in numpy array 
# We have special functions for boolean operator 

# logical_and(x1, x2, /[, out, where, 因) Compute the truth value of x1 AND x2 element-wise.

# logical_or(x1, x2, /[, out, where, casting, 因) Compute the truth value of x1 OR x2 element-wise.

# logical_not(x, /[, out, where, casting, 因) Compute the truth value of NOT x element-wise.

# logical_xor(x1, x2, /[, out, where, 因) Compute the truth value of x1 XOR x2, element-wise.
